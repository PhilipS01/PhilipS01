<img src="github-foundations.png" align="right" height="200px" />

- 💎 Pressure makes diamonds. I’m basically a mine.
- ☑️ I don’t count sheep — I count completed checklists.
- 🕰️ I don’t clock in — I break the time clock.
- ⏳ Deadlines are scared of me.
- 🛜 I rest when my WiFi’s down. Maybe.

Apart from that, I really love my personal projects and the endless commit history I call life.<br>
